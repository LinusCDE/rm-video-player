Just some random PoC of playing some video on the device.

**DISCLAIMER:** Doing that stuff may hurt the feelings of the
eink display. It may cause some perceived "burn ins" (usually
temporary) or other damage (escpecially on earlier versions of this sw).

The last commits made video playback seemingly rock solid and nice to look at.  
Performance improvements could still be done (cpu at 100% causes a lot of dropped frames if over 720p).  
See src/main.rs for preparing a video for it.
